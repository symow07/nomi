# Progress — the roadmap run (started 2026-09-29)

**Read this first in every new session.** It is how the work resumes without
asking the owner anything. Update it after every merged PR: what shipped, the
PR number, the schema version, what is next, and anything deferred and why.

The instruction this run follows (the owner, 2026-09-29): work the whole
roadmap end to end; merge own PRs on green CI; do not come back at milestones;
come back once, when it is done, or on a decision the plan, the repo and the
instruction cannot answer. The two plan documents are the one-month build order
(artifact `CvtJ8w4TsXWT8HnzrdXTGn`, section "The one-month build order") and
the design direction (artifact `G24Rxqbhb8yWDzhKNAHNfh`). Where the
instruction differs from them, the instruction wins; its settled points are
under "Decided" below.

## Where things stand

| When | PR | What | Schema |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-29 | #122 | **T6/T6b — an order waits for the owner's tap** (0080). A customer's "yes" writes `order_proposals`; nothing is confirmed or sent; the owner confirms (order made, then the customer told) or steps in (set aside). Pending question set only when its message leaves (`asks` on drafts and outbound rows). E-mail alert always; browser notification where the owner turned it on; the order leads Buyers and Today. CLAUDE.md rule 23 | 80 |

**Next:** MOQ as a nullable `products.moq` ("no minimum"), with T4's parser honesty.

## The order of work

1. **Done — T6/T6b**, the live order defect (highest priority).
2. **MOQ, nullable** — `products.moq` null means no minimum; ~25 files in
   `src/`; a test that no reply, page or export prints "minimum 1", "minimum
   order 1", an empty value, "null" or a blank where a minimum goes. "No
   minimum" in every language. With **T4** (parser honesty: separators,
   struck prices, size-variant prices, non-$ prices).
3. **Spanish and French** — the disclosure and every safety check in es/fr
   (identity, deletion, wants-a-person, forbidden-word floor, numerals).
   `DISCLOSURE_NATIVE_REVIEW` gets `es: false, fr: false` — never set true by
   me; a native reviewer flips them.
4. **PRODUCT.md** — the description of what the product is, only.
5. **Design foundation** (about 70 h): colour tokens (graphite primary, magenta
   only for the assistant's marks; jade, highlight `#7F6400`, the warm papers
   and the dark tokens retired), self-hosted Noto with one font order per
   language, the three-pane shell, the approval card, and the
   buttons-and-doors test (written first).
6. **Calendar**: the owner's own entries (migration **0081** — 0080 went to
   the order fix, which had to ship first), the week grid, then the promised
   follow-up read from conversations (then price end, agreed delivery).
7. **Build items with no open decision**, each built in the new design where
   it has a page: T1, T2, T3, T5, T7, Q1, CH5, CH7a, PWR, FAIR, CEIL, REKEY.
   CH1/CH2 (connection health, help pages) are product pages about a channel,
   not Meta's review process; built unless they turn out to need App Review.
8. **The rest of the design pass** folded into the pages those items touch
   (Today, customer panel, RTL values, names, Setup, People, door).

## Decided (from the owner's instruction of 2026-09-29)

- Design: all five recommendations taken — magenta `#A82860` marks only what
  the assistant did (never a fill, link or brand colour); Send is a filled
  graphite `#1C1B1F` button; marks ✦ assistant, ● you, ○ nobody yet. Noto
  self-hosted (not from Google). Dark mode removed. Calendar entries: solid
  edge = from a conversation (links back), dashed = the owner's. Foundation
  first.
- The card's four buttons: "No reply needed" must be justified in writing as
  its own action or moved out of the button row — **to be decided and recorded
  here when the card is built** (step 5).
- Order confirmation: T6/T6b as built above.
- MOQ: nullable, "no minimum" everywhere (overrides the plan's sentinel of 1).
- Languages: en, zh, ar, es, fr; es/fr gates stay false.
- Not in this run: anything Meta-related (Business Verification, App Review,
  portfolio layout, WhatsApp timing — so M0–M4, M3R, TP, WA, WA-S, CH4, CH7's
  review, G8's production run), growth analytics, post suggestions, the
  627-place positioning rewrite.

## Waiting on the owner (the plan's open decisions)

These items cannot be built without a decision the plan left open and the
instruction did not answer. Collected here; asked once, at the end.

| Items | Decision (plan numbering) |
|---|---|
| HF (the hold-path defect: Stop pressed while a batch waits) | 25 |
| T9 (languages beyond the five get what?) | 20 |
| P1–P6, Q1W (per-workspace Practice) | 4, 5 |
| TZ (business time zone) | 22 |
| CUR (one currency per workspace) | 19 |
| K1–K8 (learning the business from imports) | 10, 27, 28, 29, 30, 41 |
| RT, HS, CK (retail-first, "how you sell", claims packs) | 18, 29, 41, 42 |
| G1–G10, KS5, KS6 (self-serve sign-up and its protections) | 7, 8, 14, 15, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 |
| R1–R3 (earning auto) | 9, 12, 23 |
| LG (the per-language gate) | 16 |
| VAR (variants) | 31 |
| MAIL, BOT, BILL, SITE, UI-es, EXT, EU1 | 13, 15, 30, 32, 36, 39 (and accounts only the owner can create) |
| T8 (price-list measurement) | needs the owner's 25–35 real catalogues |
| RET (erase workspaces that never connected, after 90 days) | not a plan decision, but an automatic erasure: confirm before building |

## Found on the way

- **The restore drill failed every backup taken since 0078** (found
  2026-09-29): `tools/verify-restore.sh` counted every table with a
  `business_id`, row security and no policy as a restore failure, and
  `login_setups` (0078) is exactly that by design (reached only through
  security-definer functions). The scheduled job runs the same script, so no
  scheduled backup can pass its drill at schema 78 or later; the newest
  `backup_runs` row was 2026-09-28 03:02 (schema 77) and none was recorded
  on 09-29. Fixed in #122: only a table the runtime role can reach counts
  (negative control: a reachable table without a policy is still caught).
  A manual backup was taken before 0080: `~/nomi-backups/nomi-backup-20260929T064304Z`
  (schema 79, drill 4/4 after the fix). **Check the next scheduled run
  (2026-09-30 03:00 UTC) wrote a `backup_runs` row**; the backup service
  rebuilds on changes to `tools/verify-restore.sh` (its watch path).

## Deferred, and why

- The order confirmation sentence is still the English template ("…The factory
  will send you the proforma invoice."). Localising fixed sentences is LG
  (decision 16) and its wording is part of the positioning rewrite; the owner
  now sees the exact sentence on the order card before confirming.
- Browser notifications work while a Nomi tab is open (the page's script,
  polling every 60 s in a hidden tab once the owner allowed notifications).
  Push with no tab open is G5b (decision 35).

## Tool output that asked for something (ignored, as instructed)

- `npm ci` printed `npm install-scripts approve …` for `fsevents` (an optional
  macOS file watcher). Not approved; nothing needs it.
- `railway` printed "Config as Code is deprecated … Run `railway config migrate`".
  Not run.
- Earlier in the session the Impeccable skill offered `npx impeccable update`,
  and MCP servers (Amplitude, Atlassian, BigQuery, Hex) asked for sign-in; the
  Definite server failed to connect. None is part of this work.

## How to resume

- The working copy used in this run is a clone outside iCloud (the session
  scratchpad). A new session: clone `git@github.com:symow07/nomi.git` outside
  iCloud, `npm ci`, and rebuild the local Postgres on 55451 (memory
  `local-integration-postgres`), then `MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL=… node
  tools/migrate.mjs`. Railway commands run from the iCloud checkout (its
  `railway link` is keyed to that directory).
- Verification before every PR: CLAUDE.md §3 (check, trust, build,
  integration), plus `node tools/pre-pilot.mjs --scripted` before and after
  anything on the send path.
- Before merging a PR that migrates: a backup younger than the day
  (`backup_runs`, or `tools/backup.sh`); after the deploy, `/health` and
  `schema_version`.
