 * M19.1 — does the database actually have the schema this build needs?
 *
 * The failure this prevents is specific and nasty: deploy code that expects
 * migration N while the database is still at N-1. `/health` probes with
 * `select 1`, which succeeds on the OLD schema, so the deployment looks green
 * while the send path is broken. In `disabled` mode nothing drives outbound, so
 * the breakage stays invisible until the exact moment WhatsApp is switched
 * on — the one step that cannot be undone.
 *
 * Enforced at BOOT (see `assertSchemaCurrent`, wired into buildProduction), and
 * again at activation. The boot gate is the one that matters: a release audit
 * found that a stale database booted clean and reported `{"ok":true,"db":true}`,
 * because the only caller was `activationPreconditions` — a function with no
 * production call site. A guard nothing calls is not a guard.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT on /health — a public probe should not advertise the
 * schema version, for the same reason it does not advertise the commit (M17.1).
